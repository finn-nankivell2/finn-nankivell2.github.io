						<p>I developed this short game during a four-hour car trip to Kerry during the summer. It is a simple clone of the game "Sokobahn", a grid-based puzzle game about pushing blocks onto buttons. I was inspired to make it by my sister, who had a primitive version of the game installed on her digital camera, and I wanted to see if I could implement something similar quickly. The concept may not be original, but the artwork and level design is all by me.</p>
						<p>I developed the game with Python and the popular game development library, Pygame, which I am very familiar with. The game features 10 levels, an undo feature for winding back, and a reset feature for restarting the current level. Internally, I used pixel art bitmap images to encode and easily design levels, with different colours of pixels corresponding to different kinds of tiles.</p>
						<p>While I did not spend very long working on this project, I greatly enjoyed it, and learned a lot about making complete projects quickly.</p>
