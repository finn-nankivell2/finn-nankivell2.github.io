						<p>This project was created as part of a college assignment. The brief for the assignment was to use P5.js (a popular graphics programming Javascript framework) to create a "particle system", i.e. A graphical program where many instances of an object are created, rendered, then deleted. I stretched the interpretation of this brief quite far, and created a particle system where tall, building like cuboids are the particles.</p>

						<p>I did not use any 3D pipelines or programming for this project, I simply used a visual trick of drawing two squares, one offset from the other based on its distance from the center of the screen, and then joining them up with rendered polygons. The result is a satisfying, stylized 3D look. I also tweaked with the algorithm a bit to make the buildings grow in "height" the closer they got to the center of the screen to mimic a fisheye lens, and I created some lines between them to look like little roads. I also made the buildings adhere to a random gradient between the two sides of the screen to give them a nice look</p>

						<p>Overall I am very pleased with this project. I think that the visual effect looks nice, especially in motion, and while it might not be the most practical effect to know how to do, it's still good fun.</p>
