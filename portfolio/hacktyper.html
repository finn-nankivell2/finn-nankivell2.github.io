						<p>This was a quick game I created to test my Pygame game development framework. The conceit of the game is simple, you must type words out while a timer ticks down. If the word is correctly spelled and has not already been used, you gain points and it disappears. However if it is misspelled and/or has already been used, then it gets added to the stack, which grows the more mistakes you make. If the stack reaches a high enough point, then the game is over.</p>
						<p>The game's aesthetic is loosely inspired by 90s hacker media, serving as more of a joke than anything. The font is a stylized pixel art font created by me.</p>
						<p>While the game is technically "finished", I would like to expand more on it in the future with different game modes, more polish, better graphical effects, and maybe some story content.</p>
